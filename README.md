## React Learning Exercises

To help you learn React effectively, I've put together the following set of exercises that increase in complexity. Each exercise focuses on building your understanding of core React concepts and common use cases.

### Exercise 1: Introduction to React Components
**Difficulty: Beginner**

1. Create a simple functional component that renders a heading and a paragraph of text.
2. Pass props to the component and display them in the JSX.
3. Implement a button that, when clicked, updates the text content.

### Exercise 2: Managing State with useState
**Difficulty: Beginner**

1. Create a counter component that displays a number and has buttons to increment and decrement the value.
2. Use the `useState` hook to manage the counter state.
3. Add input fields to allow the user to set the initial value of the counter.

### Exercise 3: Conditional Rendering and Lists
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

1. Create a todo list application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
2. Use conditional rendering to display the todo items differently based on their completion status.
3. Implement the ability to filter the todo list by completed and incomplete tasks.

### Exercise 4: Handling Side Effects with useEffect
**Difficulty: Intermediate**

1. Create a component that fetches data from an API and displays it.
2. Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch the data when the component mounts.
3. Implement error handling and loading states for the API request.

### Exercise 5: Building a Custom Hook
**Difficulty: Advanced**

1. Create a custom hook that manages form state and validation.
2. Implement the hook to handle form submission and display error messages.
3. Use the custom hook in multiple components throughout your application.

### Exercise 6: Implementing a React-based UI Library
**Difficulty: Advanced**

1. Build a reusable button component that accepts various props for styling and functionality.
2. Extend the button component to include a loading state and disable functionality.
3. Create additional UI components (e.g., modal, accordion, table) and integrate them into a sample application.

### Exercise 7: Performance Optimization with React.memo and useCallback
**Difficulty: Advanced**

1. Create a component that renders a list of items and allows the user to filter and sort the list.
2. Implement memoization using `React.memo` and `useCallback` to optimize the performance of the component.
3. Measure and compare the performance before and after the optimizations.

These exercises cover a wide range of React concepts, from basic component creation and state management to more advanced topics like custom hooks, UI library development, and performance optimization. As you progress through the exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of React and develop the skills to build complex, production-ready applications.

Feel free to modify or expand on these exercises as needed to suit your learning goals and preferences. Good luck with your React learning journey!
